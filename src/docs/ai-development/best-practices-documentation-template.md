## Introduction
This template provides a standardized approach for creating comprehensive best practices documentation for any programming language, framework, or technology. It ensures consistency, quality, and completeness across all documentation.

## How to Use This Template
When asked to create best practices documentation for a specific technology:
1. Copy this template structure
2. Replace placeholder content with technology-specific information
3. Follow the content guidelines and examples provided
4. Ensure all required sections are included and relevant

## Template Structure
Every best practices document should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Best Practices for [Technology Name]

## Table of Contents

```

## Required Sections
All best practices documents must include these sections:

### Introduction
- Brief overview of the technology
- Purpose and scope of the document
- Who should use this guide

### Project Structure
- Recommended folder organization
- File naming patterns
- Configuration file placement
- **Must include:** Visual example of directory structure

### Naming Conventions
- Variable naming rules
- Function/method naming
- Class/module naming
- File and folder naming
- **Must include:** Examples of good vs. bad naming

### Code Quality
- Language-specific style guidelines
- Code formatting standards
- Comment and documentation standards
- **Must include:** Before/after code examples showing improvements

### Instructions for Copilot
- Specific guidelines for AI to follow
- Technology-specific patterns and conventions
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- **Must include:** At least 8-10 numbered, actionable instructions

## Optional Sections
Include these sections when relevant to the technology:

### Error Handling
- Exception handling patterns
- Logging best practices
- Graceful degradation strategies

### Performance
- Optimization techniques
- Profiling and monitoring
- Resource management

### Security
- Common vulnerabilities and prevention
- Secure coding practices
- Authentication and authorization patterns

### Testing
- Testing strategies and frameworks
- Test organization and naming
- Coverage expectations

### Documentation
- Code documentation standards
- API documentation requirements
- README and changelog guidelines

### Deployment
- Build and deployment processes
- Environment management
- Monitoring and maintenance

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Write in imperative mood for instructions ("Use", "Avoid", "Implement")
- Include rationale for recommendations when helpful
- Keep sections focused and scannable

### Code Examples
- Always specify language in code blocks
- Provide realistic, practical examples
- Include comments explaining key concepts
- Show both "before" and "after" examples when demonstrating improvements

**Example format:**
```markdown
**Before:**
```[language]
// Poor example with explanation
```

**After:**
```[language]
// Improved example with explanation
```
```

### Lists and Organization
- Use bullet points for related items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Bold key terms and concepts
- Include visual separators (horizontal rules) between major sections

## Code Examples Best Practices

### Always Include
- Language specification in code blocks
- Meaningful variable names
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Error handling where appropriate

### Example Structure
```markdown
**Example: [Specific Use Case]**
```[language]
// Brief comment explaining the purpose
function exampleFunction(param: Type): ReturnType {
  // Implementation with clear logic
  return result;
}
```
```

### Comparison Format
```markdown
**Before:**
```[language]
// Problematic code
```

**After:**
```[language]
// Improved code
```

**Why this is better:**
- Specific improvement 1
- Specific improvement 2
```

## Instructions for Copilot
1. **Follow the template structure exactly:** Use all required sections and include optional sections when relevant to the technology.
2. **Create comprehensive examples:** Provide at least 3-5 code examples per major section, showing both good and bad practices.
3. **Use technology-specific terminology:** Research and use the correct terms, conventions, and patterns for the specific technology.
4. **Include visual project structure:** Always show a directory tree example for project organization.
5. **Write actionable instructions:** Each instruction should be specific and implementable, not vague or theoretical.
6. **Provide rationale:** Explain why certain practices are recommended, especially for non-obvious guidelines.
7. **Include before/after comparisons:** Show practical improvements in code quality and organization.
8. **Research current best practices:** Use up-to-date conventions and avoid deprecated patterns.
9. **Make it scannable:** Use proper formatting, bullet points, and headers to make content easy to navigate.
10. **End with comprehensive Copilot instructions:** Include 8-10 specific, numbered guidelines for AI to follow when working with that technology.

## Conclusion
This template ensures that all best practices documentation maintains high quality, consistency, and usefulness. By following this structure and guidelines, every document will provide developers with comprehensive, actionable guidance for their chosen technology.
